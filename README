Crucial Warning for Your Model

- If you run a backtest starting from 2010 onwards, your Buy vs. Rent model will be biased.
- 2010–2021 was a historic bull run for equities (especially US tech).
- Using only this data will calculate a CAGR of ~11–12%, which makes "Renting" look artificially superior to "Buying".
- Fix: Ensure your model robustness check includes a "Lost Decade" scenario (e.g., 2000–2010 returns) where the stock market is flat for 10 years.
