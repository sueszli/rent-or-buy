Crucial Warning for Your Model

- If you run a backtest starting from 2010 onwards, your Buy vs. Rent model will be biased.
- 2010–2021 was a historic bull run for equities (especially US tech).
- Using only this data will calculate a CAGR of ~11–12%, which makes "Renting" look artificially superior to "Buying".
- Fix: Ensure your model robustness check includes a "Lost Decade" scenario (e.g., 2000–2010 returns) where the stock market is flat for 10 years.

investing in a real-estate with credit is heavily leveraged:

- ETF: Unleveraged (1:1). If market goes up 10%, you make 10k.
- House: Leveraged (usually 5:1 or 10:1). You put 100k down on a 500k house. If the house goes up 10% (to 550k), you make 50k (a 50% return on your cash).

finally: the most critical thing here is the timing.

- etf: Dotcom crash or 2008 Financial Crisis
- real estate: Prices in cities like Munich, Berlin, or Vienna doubled or tripled between 2010 and 2022.
