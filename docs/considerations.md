a mortgage is a credit used to leverage your real-estate investment:

- ETF: Unleveraged (1:1). If market goes up 10%, you make 10k
- House: Leveraged (usually 5:1 or 10:1). You put 100k down on a 500k house. If the house goes up 10% (to 550k), you make 50k (a 50% return on your cash)

timing matters:

- etf: Dotcom crash or 2008 Financial Crisis
- real estate: Prices in cities like Munich, Berlin, or Vienna doubled or tripled between 2010 and 2022

home:

- home value (relative to real estate market)
- incurring costs: mortgage, maintenance, taxes, insurance, utilities, opportunity cost of down payment, depreciation, renovation cost, property tax, etc.

renting:

- portfolio returns are all you own

TODO:

- nominal vs. real: assume 2.54% inflation
- add monthly maintenance cost for home
- add rent inflation in vienna
- add home price inflation in vienna
