compare real vs. nominal returns

- assume 2.54% inflation

a mortgage is a credit used to leverage your real-estate investment:

- ETF: Unleveraged (1:1). If market goes up 10%, you make 10k
- House: Leveraged (usually 5:1 or 10:1). You put 100k down on a 500k house. If the house goes up 10% (to 550k), you make 50k (a 50% return on your cash)

timing matters:

- etf: Dotcom crash or 2008 Financial Crisis
- real estate: Prices in cities like Munich, Berlin, or Vienna doubled or tripled between 2010 and 2022
